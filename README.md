# spectral-conversion-foil-light-transport
Monte Carlo ray-tracing framework for modeling light transport, scattering, and re-emission in perovskite flakes embedded in a polymer matrix.

# Solar Foil Monte Carlo Simulation

This repository contains a Monte Carlo ray-tracing framework for modeling light transport, scattering, and re-emission in perovskite flakes embedded in a polymer matrix, for spectral tuning in agricultural applications.  

The code simulates:
- Absorption of UV/near-UV photons
- Scattering using Mie/T-matrix theory
- Re-emission into the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) range
- Transmission efficiency for different foil parameters

## Features
- Full photon path tracking
- Customizable perovskite concentration, flake thickness, refractive index, and quantum yield
- Modular design for extension (e.g., dome structures, new scatterers)
